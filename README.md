# Cloudwatchlogsbeat

Cloudwatchlogsbeat is a [beat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) for
the [elastic stack](https://www.elastic.co/products). Its purpose is
to harvest data from AWS Cloudwatch Log Groups and ship them to a
variety of sinks that include logstash, elasticsearch etc.

**Disclaimer**: the beat is production-tested and is currently being
used to harvest thousands of stream events per minute. However, please
keep in mind that there may be bugs and that we accept no
responsibility for any kind of damage that may occur as a result.

# Description

Cloudwatchlogsbeat operates by monitoring a set of AWS Cloudwatch Log
Groups specified in its [configuration](cloudwatchlogsbeat.full.yml),
which also defines a set of configuration values that influence the
beat's operational behaviour. In general, the log groups are
periodically probed for new streams which are then polled for new
events.

The state of the beat is saved in a user-specified S3 bucket on a
per-stream basis. This way, the beat knows what is the last event that
was harvested per stream and can resume its operation once restarted.

The beat is fully concurrent in terms of the monitored log groups and
streams and makes use of AWS SDK's exponential back-off retry policy
for all its requests to the AWS APIs. However, the beat's operation is
subject to AWS limitations and throttling policies which are
summarized
[here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html).

Throttling errors are dealt with gracefully without losing stream
events (stream monitoring is resumed from where it left off) and can
be mitigated to some degree by tuning the beat's configuration with
respect to the various refresh frequencies. The beat also defines two
kinds of streams, frequently updated (aka hot) and standard, which can
be configured differently to further control/reduce the rate of AWS
API requests.

# Setup / Installation

First of all, make sure that you have
a [working go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install) (this
includes a valid `$GOPATH`).

The following steps are necessary for a working installation:

    $ go get -u github.com/e-travel/cloudwatchlogsbeat
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/e-travel/cloudwatchlogsbeat
    $ go build -i # builds the beat and builds/installs the dependencies
    $ ./cloudwatchlogsbeat -e -d '*'

# AWS configuration

Cloudwatchlogsbeat authenticates with AWS services using
the
[standard AWS guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/a-new-and-standardized-way-to-manage-credentials-in-the-aws-sdks/). This
means that the following environmental variables need to be set for
the program to use:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Alternatively, if there are profiles setup in the file
`~/.aws/credentials`, the following environmental variables are
necessary:

    AWS_PROFILE

The AWS region must be set in the beat's configuration file.

If the beat is deployed to an EC2 instance, there's also the option of
an IAM Role that is attached to the EC2 instance. In this case, the
actions that must be allowed in the IAM policy document are as
follows:

```
logs:GetLogEvents
logs:FilterLogEvents
logs:Describe*
```

plus permissions to the S3 bucket resource:
```
s3:GetObject
s3:ListBucket
s3:HeadObject
s3:PutObject
```

# Tests

The beat's tests can be executed as follows:

    $ go test -v -cover ./beater

The test coverage report can be generated by adding the
`-coverprofile=coverage.out` switch to the above command. The
generated `coverage.out` file can be then viewed using:

    $ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
